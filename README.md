# NormalExtrusionShader

I made use of the Shader Forge to simulate the Amplify Shader Editor's case.There are two effects with the motion pictures,the one used World Position's XYZ node,the other used W node.Actually,there is a problem with the XYZ node,if you change the model's position,the movement will out of control.
